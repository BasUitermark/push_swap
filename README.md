## :star2: About the Project
A project made in accordance with the push_swap project for the Codam Core Curriculum.
An entry into the world of sorting algorithms. This project aims to teach how to apply a sorting algorithm into a program.
However there are a couple of restrictions. You are only allowed to two stacks in which to transfer the numbers and a set of operations.




### :dart: Features

Operations:
- push_a: Pushes the top number from stacks b to stack a.
- push_b: Pushes the top number from stack a to stack b.
- swap_a: Swaps the top 2 numbers in stack a.
- swap_b: Swaps the top 2 numbers in stack b.
- swap_all: Performs swap_a and swap_b.
- rotate_a: Rotates the top number in stack a to the bottom.
- rotate_b: Rotates the top number in stack b to the bottom.
- rotate_al: Performs rotate_a and rotate_b.
- reverse_rotate_a: Rotate the bottom number in stack a to the top.
- reverse_rotate_b: Rotate the bottom number in stack b to the top.
- reverse_rotate_all: Performs reverse_rotate_a and reverse_rotate_b.




## 	:toolbox: Getting Started

### :gear: Installation

Start by cloning the repository into your projects includes filder:
```c
git clone https://github.com/BasUitermark/push_swap.git
```

Compile by using make:
```c
make
```

Don't forget to include the library in your project:
```c
#include "includes/push_swap.h"
```

Or if you add the library path to your header file:
```c
#include "push_swap.h"
```



## :eyes: Usage

```c
./push_swap 2 5 86 13
```



## :compass: Roadmap

* [ ] Finish documentation.
* [ ] Clean up code.
